            "content": "# Building a Terminal UI with Go and Bubble Tea\n\nRecently I've been exploring the world of terminal user interfaces (TUIs), and I have to say—Bubble Tea has completely changed how I think about CLI applications.\n\n## Why Terminal UIs?\n\nIn an age of web apps and mobile interfaces, why would anyone care about terminal UIs? A few reasons:\n\n- **Speed**: No browser overhead, instant startup\n- **Accessibility**: Works over SSH, in containers, anywhere\n- **Focus**: No distractions, just you and your workflow\n\n## Getting Started with Bubble Tea\n\nBubble Tea follows the Elm architecture, which means your app consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Model** - Your application state\n2. **Update** - How state changes in response to messages\n3. **View** - How to render your state as a string\n\n```go\ntype model struct {\n    cursor int\n    items  []string\n}\n\nfunc (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {\n    switch msg := msg.(type) {\n    case tea.KeyMsg:\n        switch msg.String() {\n        case \"up\":\n            m.cursor--\n        case \"down\":\n            m.cursor++\n        }\n    }\n    return m, nil\n}\n```\n\nThe elegance of this pattern really shines when building complex, stateful applications.\n\n## What I Built\n\nI created a portfolio viewer that fetches data from a Rails API and displays it beautifully in the terminal. Complete with navigation, animations, and even syntax highlighting for code snippets.\n\nStay tuned for more posts on this journey!"

Here's why Rails was the right choice for my portfolio API.\n\n## Convention Over Configuration\n\nRails' opinionated nature is a feature, not a bug. Instead of spending hours debating folder structure or ORM choices, I can focus on building features.\n\n## Rapid Development\n\nWith generators, migrations, and a rich ecosystem of gems, Rails lets me move fast:\n\n```bash\nrails g model Post title:string content:text published_at:datetime\nrails db:migrate\n```\n\nIn two commands, I have a fully-functional model with database backing.\n\n## The Ecosystem\n\n- **Blueprinter** for JSON serialization\n- **RSpec** for testing\n- **Rack CORS** for API security\n\nThese battle-tested tools mean I'm building on solid foundations.\n\n## API-Only Mode\n\nRails 5+ introduced API-only mode, stripping away the view layer overhead. My app boots faster and has a smaller footprint.\n\nFor a personal project where I'm the only developer, Rails' productivity benefits far outweigh any performance considerations."

Here's my experience using it for this portfolio.\n\n## What is Kamal?\n\nKamal deploys containerized applications to bare metal servers. No Kubernetes complexity, no managed container services—just Docker and SSH.\n\n## The Setup\n\nConfiguration lives in a single YAML file:\n\n```yaml\nservice: portfolio-api\nimage: myuser/portfolio-api\n\nservers:\n  web:\n    - 192.168.1.100\n\nregistry:\n  username: myuser\n  password:\n    - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\n```\n\n## Deploy in One Command\n\n```bash\nkamal deploy\n```\n\nThat's it. Kamal builds the image, pushes it, and rolls out to your servers with zero downtime.\n\n## What I Love\n\n- **Simplicity**: No cloud-specific lock-in\n- **Control**: I own my servers\n- **Cost**: A $5 VPS is all I need\n\nFor small to medium projects, Kamal hits the sweet spot between simplicity and capability."

A portfolio lets you demonstrate your skills:\n\n- **Clean code**: Link to GitHub repos\n- **Problem solving**: Explain your approach\n- **Communication**: Write about your journey\n\n## The Tech Stack Choice\n\nI deliberately chose an unconventional stack—a Go terminal client talking to a Rails API. Why?\n\n1. It's memorable\n2. It demonstrates systems thinking\n3. It shows I can work across paradigms\n\n## Content Over Flash\n\nFancy animations are nice, but recruiters care about substance. Focus on:\n\n- Clear project descriptions\n- Measurable outcomes\n- Your unique perspective\n\n## Keep It Updated\n\nA stale portfolio signals disengagement. Regular blog posts show you're actively learning and growing.\n\nYour portfolio is a living document—treat it that way."
